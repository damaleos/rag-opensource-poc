# rag-opensource-poc

This is a proof-of-concept project to explore the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 📌 Goals

- Evaluate the behavior of a basic RAG system.
- Identify integration challenges with external knowledge sources.
- Lay the groundwork for the final system development.

## 🚀 Tentative Technologies

- Python
- LangChain / LangGraph
- FAISS / Chroma
- HuggingFace Transformers
- FastAPI (for the web prototype)
- Docker (to simplify environment setup)

## 🧠 Current Status

Currently in early design stage. This project will serve as a foundation for experimentation while the final system is being specified.
